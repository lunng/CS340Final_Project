# CS340Final_Project

Project files for the CS 340 final project!

Notes for Grading Instructor, Ben McCamish:
- Code fixed between the presentation and submission is as follows
..- CSS edits to make site look more pretty
..- IndexError fix checks if search returned any results prior to returning from query
- During presentation, query with empty checkboxes broke due to aforementioned indexerror, blank checkboxes will still set "Names" as a query item
- Server.py is the only file that needs to be run. All other scripts were for collecting, interpreting, and displaying data
- whoosh_script.py is a dependency of server.py
- Scripts were used to generate static files, so they may now contain issues if you try to run them without the files being in place
